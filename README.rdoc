= assert_performance

+assert_performance+ supplies test/unit assertions for verifying that
blocks of code have certain performance characteristics. For example,
you can write something like this in a test:

  assert_performance :max_queries => 1, :max_time => 50 do
    Person.find_by_id(1)
  end

and it will verify that the block of code only performs one
active_record query and takes less than 50 ms.
